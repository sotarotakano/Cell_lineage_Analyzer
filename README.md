# Cell_lineage_Analyzer
MATLAB scripts for analyzing bacterial single-cell growth dynamics data from microscopic images.
The codes are specifically designed for Schnitzcells data structure (Young et al., 2012).

The main programs are "exportschnitzdata_subtreegrowth.m" or "exportschnitzdata_lineagegrowth.m",
these are prepared for analyzing retrospectively growth history or chronologically subtree growth, respectively.
